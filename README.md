i wanted to make a duck controller that can let the player use wing shaped controller that they can flap to simulate the ducks movement. it has a accelrometer and gyro inside so it knows how fast and what direction it is facing. it suppose to come with 2 as a pair so the player can have 1 for each hand. the player flaps the controller to fly in to the air and depends on which one is raised higher the direction will determined by that. the controllers will have one button each. the player can evade the shots by flaping the controller and making the duck move on the screen.
